Hey everyone! 

This is a small project that I've started to help me get accustomed to Godot. It's also something that I'm doing as a part of my Comp Sci class.

I'm not sure how far I'll be taking this project, but I'll try to implement a main menu, powerups, Flappy bird mechanics, UI, etc. 

I'm also quite unexperienced with Git, Github, etc, so let me know if there's anything I should do/change to improve this repository or my project!
